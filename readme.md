# Hyperapp + Webpack boilerplate

Lots of boilerplates around. Lots of bloat.

## Minimalist?

I install hyperapp only. It no work.

I add webpack, still give error.

Babel transpiler, now it working. Enjoy.

## Installation

```sh
npm install hyperapp-webpack
```

Or just clone this and install dependencies.

index.js includes the basic counter example of [hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp).

To run it after installing : 

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

## Dependencies

I included the latest versions of Webpack, Babel and hyperapp.
Only "expendables" are webpack-cli and webpack-dev-server. So they're included in devDeps.
